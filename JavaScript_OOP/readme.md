# Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in Javascript

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. 


An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior for example, a human being has atrributes of sex, gender, height, color, weight e.t.c. Therefore can be considered as  an object during OOP.

There are 4 basics of OOP that is;  Abstraction, Encapsulation , Inheritance and Polymorhism. These four basics help us create the behaviours that OOP follows as shown in the repository.

During Abstraction we strive to hide the object's complexities and only expose a user to the simplicity they require to perform and use the program.

During Encapsulation, we create objects that are fully defined in themselves.

During Inheritance, we create parent and child objects to save memory and also make work easier.

This repository attempts to give you a few beginner friendly examples that will further make these concepts easier to understand.

Happy Learning!
